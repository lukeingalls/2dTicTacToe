# 2dTicTacToe

Opening index.html in a web browser will show the game and you can play it. Things ought to be straightforward usewise. The javascript is fairly well documented and is the main source of features in the program.

# Current non-working features: 
- Inputting names for players does nothing.
- Hard and easy mode on computer are the same. Only random moves get played for now.
